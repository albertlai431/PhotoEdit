## Description
 Edit your photos with PhotoEdit! PhotoEdit allows users to open images and save them as png or jpg from any directory on the computer. It also allows users to perform a multitude of changes to their image in real-time, including rotations, flips, color filters, corrections including brightness, transparency, blurs, and contrast adjustions, and general effects like warm, cool, negative, and greyscale. There is also an undo and redo feature, allowing users to trace their edits. When the user hovers over a menu button, a pop-up hover appears, showing the name of that menu button.
